## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Kept deterministic evidence scoring and fleet state machines in Tier 1 domain code; the evidence and
  fleet services remain Tier 2 coordination and adapter boundaries.
- Standardized the decision metric as an evidence score across the architecture, testing, limitations,
  and security documentation.
- Split the normative documentation set so every fact has one home, per ADR-0016
  (now Accepted): `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/CONTRACTS.md`, `docs/SAFETY.md`,
  `docs/TESTING.md`, and `docs/operating-parameters.md`.
  `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` drops from 510 to ~300 lines and keeps sequenced
  delivery only; `AGENTS.md` drops from 249 to ~180 lines and keeps process rules
  only. Zero substantive lines are now duplicated across the set.
- Added a document precedence rule and a "Decided by" column linking each
  confirmed decision to its ADR, with `—` where a decision still owes one. Neither
  governing document previously referenced `docs/adr/` at all.
- Reconciled the plan with its own decision log: the durable store is Postgres per
  ADR-0003 (the plan still specified the superseded SQLite store), approvals are
  exempt from idempotent replay per ADR-0006, replay isolation is structural per
  ADR-0009, imagery is artifact-only per ADR-0013, and the replay-determinism
  oracle compares reduced dashboard state rather than raw event streams.
- Restated the coverage gate per language. The former flat "95% across statements,
  branches, functions, and lines" was not computable: `coverage.py` has no
  function-coverage metric and statements and lines are the same measurement.
- Accepted ADR-0015 and ADR-0016, both of which were already load-bearing in
  tooling while still marked Proposed.
- Recorded ADR-0002's decision that paid Anthropic or OpenAI models are permitted for
  the Agent Mesh `general` and `planning` roles under an enforced USD $50 cap with
  a persisted spend ledger and pre-call enforcement. The three edge agents stay on
  local Ollama, and local-only operation remains a supported, tested configuration
  so no release gate depends on a paid API.

### Added

- ADR-0023 and blocking pre-push/CI gates for cognitive complexity, multi-language duplication, and
  independent Tier 1 mutation runs. Mutation results are scored per module; the survivor registry is
  exact, expiring, and cannot remove survivors from the score denominator.
- Check-only hooks for the commit, commit-message, push, checkout, merge, and pre-merge stages; GitHub
  Actions re-runs the same fail-closed entry points, with shared fixtures covering hook activation,
  revision ranges, environment hygiene, diagram integrity, and dependency synchronization.
- Offline, fail-closed gates for contract-artifact ownership, per-member statement and branch coverage,
  and domain import boundaries; active members fail on missing manifests, fixtures, schemas, tiers, or
  measurable source.
- A fail-closed, whole-tree Arrange-Act-Assert checker for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vitest, and
  Playwright tests, with conformance coverage for nested Python assertions, dynamic registrations,
  syntax-based imports, and bare `expect(...)` assertions.
- A Python 3.14.7 uv application workspace with five typed library packages, six typed service packages,
  explicit per-member risk tiers, and one lock resolved for macOS arm64 and Linux aarch64; Agent Mesh
  remains isolated behind its Python 3.13.15 interpreter pin.
- ADR-0024 defining the exact single-operator local API boundary: loopback-only binding, Host validation
  on every request, browser-Origin validation for mutations, and a fresh per-runtime bearer for the three
  state-changing endpoints. Canonical digest serialization remains blocked on its own future ADR.
- ADR-0022 defining recursive integrity requirements for editable diagram sources, generated PNG
  signatures, and hashes of both artifacts.
- ADR-0021 defining the offline contract-artifact manifest and ownership requirements.
- ADR-0020 pinning uv 0.12.5 across local development and CI.
- ADR-0019 recording the fail-closed activation contract and exact verification toolchain.
- ADR-0018 defining mandatory, syntax-aware Arrange-Act-Assert structure for every project-owned
  executable test.
- ADR-0017 naming `mutmut` 3.7.0, a 90% killed-mutant score, and a risk tier for
  every package — discharging the two deferrals ADR-0015 left open.
- `docs/LIMITATIONS.md`, stating what the system does and does not model for a
  reader from the search-and-rescue domain.
- `docs/security/threat-model.md` and
  `docs/security/approval-bypass-catalogue.md`, the latter enumerating 35 bypass
  attempts so the "zero authorized actions" target quantifies over a defined set.

- Architecture decision records under `docs/adr/`, covering the self-hosted
  open-source Agent Mesh baseline, paid orchestration under an enforced budget, Postgres as the
  durable mission store, split Python runtimes, the deterministic command
  gateway, proposal-bound approvals, replay isolation, and the quality regime.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` describing the branching model, commit convention, and what
  runs at each stage.
- An editable Graphviz architecture overview with its generated PNG and integrity sidecar.
